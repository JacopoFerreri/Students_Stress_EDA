# Students_Stress_EDA

This repository contains a personal project in which I used a public datatset to put in practice some EDA techniques during the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certiicate course.

Data was available at the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rxnach/student-stress-factors-a-comprehensive-analysis with Apache 2.0 license.

A downloaded version of the dataset is made available here in .csv format. This is the file that was used to develop the Jupyter notebook that shows the EDA analysis that was performed.
