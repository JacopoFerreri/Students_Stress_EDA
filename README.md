# Students_Stress_EDA

This repository contains a personal project in which I used a public datatset to put in practice some EDA techniques during the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certiicate course.

Data was available at the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rxnach/student-stress-factors-a-comprehensive-analysis with Apache 2.0 license.

A downloaded version of the dataset is made available here in .csv format. This is the file that was used to develop the Jupyter notebook that shows the EDA analysis that was performed.

The analysis begins with a general exploration of the dataset, then we check  for data quality to understand whether it needs further cleaning/wrangling. In order to apply feature engineering features' distributions are checked. Some insights are drawn from the data and three possible statistical tests are proposed. One of these tests  is actually performed using a Z-score test. The notebook end with feature selection for the possible futre use of a ML model, and some hints for future research.
